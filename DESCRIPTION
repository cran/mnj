Description: Perform FlexBoost in R. FlexBoost is a newly suggested algorithm based on AdaBoost by adjusting adaptive loss functions. Not only FlexBoost but also other machine learning algorithms (e.g. Support Vector Machines) will be added. For more details on FlexBoost see Jeon, Y. S., Yang, D. H., & Lim, D. J. (2019) <doi:10.1109/access.2019.2938356>.
